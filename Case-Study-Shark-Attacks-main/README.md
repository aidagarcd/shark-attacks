# Case-Study-Shark-Attacks
In this project, I worked in tandem with Aida Garc√≠a and Samuel Carmona on the Shark database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felipeesc/shark-attack-dataset).

In this notebook, we will go step by step through our thought process in working with this database and the problems we encountered along the way.

It can be divided into 3 main parts:

1. Cleaning and standardizing the data, selecting the columns that need to be cleaned and worked with.
2. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and plotting some variables to understand their relationships.
3. Training a machine learning algorithm.
